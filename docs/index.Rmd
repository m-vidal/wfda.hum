**Dates:** 28 - 30 November 2023

**Venue:** De Krook, Miriam Makebaplein 1 Ghent, Belgium

**Enroll at** [UGhent site](https://www.ugent.be/doctoralschools/en/doctoraltraining/courses/specialistcourses/ahl/functional-data-analysis-applications-digital-augmented-humanities-1)

## **Workshop description**

This course aims at introducing students to the analysis of data in the form of curves. The course will last 3 days, comprising lectures connected to practical hands-on sessions, and (the last day) more advanced talks by experts. After having had an introduction to theory and tools, students will collect curve data in the ASIL lab (De Krook) and learn how to analyze them. Emphasis is on **functional data analysis**. Materials (text and tools, such as R and RStudio) will be distributed so that students can prepare themselves before they attend the course.
